            Hi, we’re James and Kiki — partners in life, road trips, and now this little business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past few years, we’ve taken countless drives together: across national parks, along wild coastlines, through small towns we’d never heard of. Some trips were carefully planned, others totally spontaneous. But each one left us with memories we never wanted to forget.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Art of the Road Trip</strong> started as a personal project — just a way to remember the paths we’d taken. But when friends started asking for custom maps of their own adventures, we realized this idea could matter to others, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we help people like you turn your travels into beautiful, print-ready keepsakes — the kind you’ll actually want to hang on your wall. Designed with intention. Built with love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for being here. We hope our little corner of the internet inspires your next adventure — or helps you remember a great one.
